Stuck in vim?
=======================
Exiting vim is as simple as
```
Control-Z
[1]+  Stopped                 vim
home$ kill vim
bash: kill: vim: arguments must be process or job IDs
home$ killall vim
home$ killall vim
home$ killall vim
home$ killall -9 vim
[1]+  Killed                  vim

```
Or for better ideas see [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-to-exit-the-vim-editor),
