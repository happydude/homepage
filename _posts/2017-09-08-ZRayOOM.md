title: PHP Out of Memory and Z-Ray
---
I recently spent a lot of time trying to debug why a long running build script written in php would run out of memory.
The script loops through a large result set instantiating objects using those results and doing various things.

In PHP5.6 garbage collection was cleaning up the objects as we were done with them. Not so it seemed when moving to PHP7.1, memory
use would slowly grow on each iteration until the script died.

I tried things like ```xdebug_debug_zval( 'variable' );``` but was at a loss because the refcount showed the garbage collection should work.

Turns out the problem had nothing to do with PHP7.1, it was a coincidence and had to to with using Zend Server and Z-Ray.
Zend Server 9.1 added the ability for Z-Ray to monitor scripts run from the command line.
Though a useful new feature, this had the side effect of causing a build script written in php to suddenly start running out of memory.

Thankfully you can disable z-ray and z-ray data collection as needed:
```php
if (function_exists('zray_disable')) {
    zray_disable(true); //true disables data collection
}
```
