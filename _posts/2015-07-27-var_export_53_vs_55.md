title: var_export() 5.3 fatal to 5.5 warning
---

Seems using var_export on objects with recursive dependencies got demoted from a fatal to a warning somewhere between php 5.3 and 5.5

5.3
PHP Fatal error:  Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency?
 'type’ => 1,
 'message’ => ‘Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency?’,

5.5
Warning: var_export does not handle circular references 
 'type’ => 2,
 'message’ => 'var_export does not handle circular references’,
