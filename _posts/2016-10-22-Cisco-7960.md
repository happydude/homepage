title: Cisco 7960 outgoing calls on CallCentric

<p>In the xkcd spirit of <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/" alt="Wisdom of the Ancients"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png"></a></p>

<p>If you have an obsolete Cisco 7960 that can't make outgoing calls on CallCentric.com
but it registers and accepts calls make sure in your SIPDefault.cnf config file callerid_blocking is set to zero. </p>
<p>If this is enabled <a href="http://www.callcentric.com/">callcentric</a> rejects the call as if it was unauthorized.  Doh!</p>
