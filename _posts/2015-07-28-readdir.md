title: readdir() fails with false or null?
---

Had fun today with readdir(), this function expects to be passed a valid handle that was created with opendir().  The php documentation states: "Returns the entry name on success or FALSE on failure". Trouble can happen if you assume opendir() is going to return a valid resource. If opendir() is given an invalid directory and fails then false is returned. Passing anything but a resource to readdir() results in the function returning null, not false.

```php
while (false !== readdir())
```

So today I came across a case of a recursive while loop conditioned on readdir() not being false, since another bug had passed opendir() an invalid directory.  That created a cool loop that filled the server logs with PHP Warnings from readdir().

Based on a bug report (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54673) that links to http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.internal.php by convention functions passed invalid parameters will return NULL.
